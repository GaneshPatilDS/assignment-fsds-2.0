    "Q.1) Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. Reusability: Functions can be reused in other programs, which can save development time and increase         code    quality.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. Modularity: Functions allow a program to be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces, which         can make the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",

    "Q.2) When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called ?\n",

    "          The code in a function runs when the function is called.\n",
    "    When you define a function, WE specify the code that should run when the function is called, but that       code is not executed until the function is actually called.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "      For example, if you have a function named \"myFunction\" that contains a print statement, the statement       will not be executed until the function is called.\n",

    "Q.3)What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    'def' statement is used to create a function. The general syntax for creating a function is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "    # function code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q.4)What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "      for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "          def myFunction(x, y):\n",
    "             return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "          result = myFunction(1, 2)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "       In this example, \"myFunction\" is the function and myFunction(1, 2) is the function call. The function        call passes the values 1 and 2 as arguments to the function, which then performs its operation and          returns                  the sum of 3, which is then assigned to the variable result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times, while a function call is the specific instance of executing that function with given inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5) How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "      In a Python program, there is only one global scope. Local scopes are created whenever a function is         called, and the number of local scopes in a program depends on the number of times functions are              called.Each function call creates a new local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6)What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a function call returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables defined within that scope are no longer accessible. This is known as \"variable scope\" in programming, and it is a fundamental concept in many programming languages, including Python. The memory used by these variables is also freed up by the garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.7) What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    A return value is a value that is returned by a function after it has finished executing\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    It is possible to have a return value in an expression, where the return value of a function is used as     part of a larger expression. For example, you could have an expression like:\n",
    "\n",
    "        result = math.sqrt(a) + math.sqrt(b)\n",
    "           \n",
    "   Here the math.sqrt() is a function that calculates square root of the passed argument and returns it ,       which is being used in the expression to add square roots of a and b. The value returned by math.sqrt()     in this case is used as part of the larger expression and the final value is assigned to result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.8) If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function ?  \n",
    "        \n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     If a function does not have a return statement, then the return value of a call to that function is          None. \n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "       For example, the following function does not have any return statement:\n",
    "             def print_hello():\n",
    "                 print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "       If you call print_hello() function, it will print \"Hello\" but the return value of this function will        be None.\n",

    "Q.9)How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",

    "Q.10) What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "   In Python, None is a special value that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is not considered as a data type, but a special constant. It is of a built-in data type called NoneType. \n",

    "\n",
    "  The sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic is an example of an import statement in Python, which is used   to bring in code from other modules or packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The specific import statement import areallyourpetsnamederic is trying to import a module or package named   \"areallyourpetsnamederic\", which probably doesn't exist in the Python standard library or any other         commonly used library. It might be possible that it is a custom module or package created by the user or     some other developer and is available in the project's directory or in the Python .\n",

    "   \n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If there is a bacon() function in a spam module, after importing the spam module, we can call the bacon() function by using the dot notation:\n",

    "\n",
    "    import spam\n",
    "    spam.bacon()\n",
    "    \n",

    "Q.13)What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "      There are several ways to prevent a program from crashing when it encounters an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1.Try-except blocks: we can use try-except blocks to catch specific errors and handle them gracefully.        This way, the program can continue to run even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2.Logging: You can use logging to record errors and other important events in the program. This way,          you can track the history of errors and debug the program more easily.\n",

    "Q.14)What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The purpose of the try clause is to define a block of code that may cause an exception to be raised, and to specify what should happen if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "The except clause is used to handle exceptions that are raised within the try block. The purpose of the except clause is to specify what should happen if a particular exception is raised within the try Block.\n",
