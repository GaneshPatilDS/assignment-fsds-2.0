    "1. The relationship between def statements and lambda expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both def statements and lambda expressions are used to define functions in Python. The main difference between them is in their syntax and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- def statements: A def statement is used to define a regular function with a name, parameters, and a block of code that executes when the function is called. The function can have any number of statements and can be multi-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a def statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- lambda expressions: A lambda expression is an anonymous function, meaning it does not have a name. It is defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by a list of parameters and a single expression. Lambda functions are typically used for short, one-liner functions where a full def statement would be overly verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a lambda expression:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The benefit of lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of lambda expressions is their conciseness and the ability to create small, throw-away functions without the need to give them a formal name. They are often used in situations where defining a full function using a def statement would be unnecessary and would clutter the code. Lambda expressions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map()`: The `map()` function applies a given function to each item in an iterable (e.g., list) and returns a new iterable with the results. It takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable on which to apply the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "# squared will be [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter()`: The `filter()` function filters the items from an iterable based on a given function's result. It returns a new iterable containing only the items for which the function returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "# even_numbers will be [2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reduce()`: The `reduce()` function, previously available in Python's built-in `functools` module (from Python 2.6 to 3.7), is used to reduce an iterable to a single value by applying the function cumulatively to the items. However, in Python 3, `reduce()` has been moved to the `functools` module, so it needs to be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
    "# sum_of_numbers will be 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function annotations and how they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function annotations are a way to attach arbitrary metadata to function arguments and return values. Annotations are defined using colons after the parameter or return value and are expressions that are evaluated at function definition time. However, they do not affect the function's behavior and are purely informational.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the function `add()` has annotations specifying that `x` and `y` should be of type `int`, and the return value should also be of type `int`. These annotations can be accessed using the `__annotations__` attribute of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recursive functions and how they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions are functions that call themselves during their execution. They are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same nature. Recursive functions must have a base case that stops the recursion and prevents infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "6. General design guidelines for coding functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions should have a clear purpose and perform a single task.\n",
    "- Use meaningful names for functions that describe their functionality.\n",
    "- Keep functions short and avoid writing long, complex functions.\n",
    "- Avoid using global variables inside functions whenever possible.\n",
    "- Always provide proper documentation (docstrings) for functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.\n",
    "- Use function annotations to specify types when appropriate.\n",
    "- Write functions that are reusable and don't rely on specific external contexts.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ways functions can communicate results to a caller:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return values: Functions can return one or multiple values using the `return` statement. The caller can capture these returned values and use them in further processing.\n",
    "- Output parameters: Functions can use input parameters as output parameters. The function modifies the input parameters' values, and the caller can access the updated values after calling the function.\n",
    "- Exceptions: Functions can raise exceptions to communicate errors or exceptional conditions to the caller.\n",
    "- Printing: Functions can print results directly to the console, but this is generally not recommended for functions intended to be used in a modular way. It is more suitable for debugging or display purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
