    "     in Python, \"[]\" is used to create an empty list. Lists are a built-in data structure in Python that allow you to store a collection of items in a single place. The items in a list can be of any type, such as strings, integers, or other objects. Once a list is created, items can be added to it using the append() method .\n",

    "    In Python, there are two main operators that can be used to combine or replicate lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.The + operator is used for list concatenation. This operator combines two or more lists by appending the      elements of one list to the end of the other list. For example:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "     list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "     list3 = list1 + list2\n",
    "     print(list3)\n",
    "\n",
    "would return: This would output '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]'\n",
    "\n",
    " 2.The * operator is used for list replication. This operator creates a new list by repeating the elements of    an existing list a specified number of times. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "    list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    list2 = list1 * 3\n",

    "\n",
    "would return: This would output '[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]'\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that, The * operator when used with list, creates a new list with the elements of the original list repeated 'n' times, where 'n' is the number that you are multiplying the list with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.10)What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both append() and insert() are used to add elements to a list, but they work in slightly different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.The append() method adds an item to the end of an existing list. It takes one argument, which is the         item  to be added.  For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "      fruits = ['apple', 'banana']\n",
    "    \n",
    "      fruits.append('orange')\n",
    "      print(fruits)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This would output ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.The insert() method adds an item to a specific position in an existing list. It takes two arguments:         the first is the index at which the item should be inserted, and the second is the item to be added.          For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "       fruits = ['apple', 'banana']\n",
    "       fruits.insert(1, 'orange')\n",
    "       print(fruits)\n",
    "       \n",
    "This would output ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']\n",
    "\n",
    "So the main difference between append() and insert() is that append() adds the item at the end of the list, whereas insert() adds the item at a specific position in the list, and it takes an additional argument which is the position in the list where you want to insert the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.11) What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "     In Python, there are two main methods for removing items from a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.The remove() method removes the first occurrence of a specified item from a list. It takes one argument,     which is the item to be removed.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n",
    "    fruits.remove('banana')\n",
    "    print(fruits)\n",
    "This would output '['apple', 'orange']'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  2.The insert() method adds an item to a specific position in an existing list. It takes two arguments: the     first is the index at which the item should be inserted, and the second is the item to be added.             FOR example:\n",

    "    fruits = ['apple', 'banana']\n",

    "Q.12)Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: \n",
    "\n",
    "   List values and string values are similar in that they both can store a collection of items. However,        there are a few key differences between lists and strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Lists are mutable, while strings are immutable. This means that you can change the values of a list           after it is created, but you cannot change the values of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Lists can store items of any type, while strings can only store characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Lists are enclosed by square brackets \"[ ]\", while strings are enclosed by quotes ' ' or \" \".\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Lists have a set of built-in methods, such as append(), insert(), and remove(), while strings have a         set of built-in methods such as lower(), upper(), and split().\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these differences, lists and strings are similar in that they can be indexed, sliced, and iterated over. Both lists and strings can be used to store and manipulate collections of items, but the way you work with them and the types of operations you can perform on them are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.13)Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tuples and lists are both used to store collections of items in Python, but there are a few key               differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1. Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable. This means that you can change the values of a list           after it is created, but you cannot change the values of a tuple. Once a tuple is created, its values         cannot be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2. Lists are defined using square brackets \"[ ]\", while tuples are defined using parentheses \"( )\" or by         just separating the values with commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3. Lists have a set of built-in methods, such as append(), insert() and remove(), while tuples do not           have any built-in methods for adding or removing items.\n",
    "\n",
    "     4. Lists are generally used for storing similar type of elements where as tuples are used for storing           different type of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall, the main difference between tuples and lists is that lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable. Tuples are often used when you want to store a set of items that should not be changed throughout the program, while lists are better suited for situations where the items may need to be modified.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q.14)How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To create a tuple that only contains the integer 42, you can use parentheses and separate the value with a   comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     my_tuple = (42,)\n",
    "   \n",
    "    This creates a tuple with one element, the integer 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that if you want to create a tuple with only one element, you must include a trailing comma after the element. Without it, Python will interpret the parentheses as indicating a mathematical operation rather than creating a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_tuple = (42) # this is not tuple, it is 42\n",
    "    \n",
