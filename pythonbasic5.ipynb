    "ANS: \n",
    "\n",
    "    An empty dictionary can be created using curly braces {} or the built-in dict() constructor with no         arguments. Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "Q.2)What is the value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:  \n",
    "\n",
    "       The value of the dictionary key 'foo' with the value 42 would be 42. You can access the value of a          key in a dictionary using the key inside square brackets [] or the get() method. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      my_dict = {'foo': 42}\n",
    "      print(my_dict['foo'])  # Output: 42\n",

    "    3.Dictionaries use keys to access values, while lists use indexes.\n",

    "\n",
    "    If we try to access the value of the key 'foo' in a dictionary spam that has only the key-value pair         {'bar': 100}, it will raise a KeyError because the key 'foo' does not exist in the dictionary.\n",

    "     \n",
    "On the other hand, the expression 'cat' in spam.keys() checks if the key 'cat' is present among the list of keys in the dictionary spam. The method .keys() returns a list with the keys of the dictionary.\n",

    "    we can \"pretty print\" dictionary values using the json module and the json.dumps() function. The            json.dumps() function takes a Python object, such as a dictionary, and converts it to a JSON string,        which is a human-readable format. The json.dumps() method has an optional parameter indent, which when      set to a non-negative integer, will format the JSON output with that many spaces for each level of          indentation.\n",
