    " ANS:\n",
    " \n",
    "    1) Integer: An integer is a whole number, such as 1, 2, or -5. It can be positive or negative and has no        decimal point. It can be used to represent numerical values.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    2) String: A string is a sequence of characters, such as \"hello\" or \"goodbye\". It is enclosed in               quotation marks ,either single or double. It can be used to represent textual data\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "    3) Float: A float, short for \"floating-point number,\" is a number with a decimal point, such as 3.14 or       -0.01. It can be used to represent decimal numbers and scientific notation.\n",

    "ANS:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     1)  in Python, an expression is made up of one or more values, variables, and operators. For example, 2         2+3,\"hello\" + \"world\", or x * y.\n",
    "     2) All expressions in Python evaluate to a single value. This means that the interpreter will take the        expression and return a single value such as a number, string or boolean. For example, the expression        2+3 will evaluate to the value 5, and the expression \"hello\" + \"world\" will evaluate to the string             \"hello world\". The value returned by an expression can be assigned to a variable, used as an               argument in a function, or printed to the screen.\n",

    " Q.5) This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    " expression and a statement?\n",
    " \n",
    " ANS:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1)An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value.       for example, 2 + 3, \"hello\" + \"world\", or x * y are all expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2)A statement, on the other hand, is a command or instruction that tells the computer to perform a            specific action or task. An assignment statement, like spam = 10, is a type of statement that assigns a      value to a variable. In this case, the value 10 is being assigned to the variable \"spam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    3)  Another example of a statement is a function call, like print(\"hello world\"). In this case, the           is telling the computer to execute the function print() and pass in the string \"hello world\" as an            argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4)In summary, an expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a         single value, while a statement is a command or instruction that tells the computer to perform a              action or task.\n",

    "    After running the code, the variable bacon will contain the value 22. The statement bacon + 1 is an         expression that evaluates to the value 23, but it is not assigned to the variable bacon. So the value of     bacon remains 22.If WE want to update the value of bacon, you would have to re-assign it like this:         bacon = bacon + 1\n",

    "2.'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1)The value of the expression 'spam'+'spamspam' would be 'spamspamspam'. This is because the + operator      is    used to concatenate strings, meaning it combines two strings together to form a new string. In this    case,    the string 'spam' is being concatenated with the string 'spamspam', resulting in the new string    'spamspamspam'.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2)In python, when a string is multiplied with an integer, it creates a new string by concatenating the        original string that number of times. So 'spam'*3 will create a new string by concatenating 'spam'          three times.\n",

    "Q.8) Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "     In Python, variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with      a number. This is because Python uses the first character of a variable name to determine if it's a          variable or a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"eggs\" is a valid variable name because it starts with a letter.\n",
    "\n",

    "    In Python, there are three built-in functions that can be used to get the integer, floating-point           number, or string version of a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "       1)int() - This function can be used to convert a value to an integer. For example, int(3.14) will              return the integer value 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "       2)float() - This function can be used to convert a value to a floating-point number. For example,              float(5) will return the value 5.0, which is a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "      3)str() - This function can be used to convert a value to a string. For example, str(5) will return           the string value \"5\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.10) Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "      'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) This expression causes an error because we are trying to concatenate a string and an integer without       any explicit type casting. The + operator is used for both addition and concatenation in Python, but         when it is used to concatenate a string and an integer, it throws an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2) To fix this, we would need to convert the integer 99 to a string using the str() function, like          this:\n",
