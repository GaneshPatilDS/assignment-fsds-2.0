    "1. When using the `PdfFileReader()` and `PdfFileWriter()` functions from the `PyPDF2` library, the File objects should be opened in the        following modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `PdfFileReader()`: The File object should be opened in binary mode ('rb').\n",
    "   - `PdfFileWriter()`: The File object should be opened in binary mode ('wb').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To get a `Page` object for page 5 from a `PdfFileReader` object, you can use the `getPage()` method and pass the index of the page (zero-    based) as an argument. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   page = pdf_reader.getPage(4)  # Page 5 (index 4)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `numPages` variable of a `PdfFileReader` object stores the number of pages in the PDF document. You can access it using                   `pdf_reader.numPages`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If a `PdfFileReader` object's PDF is encrypted with the password \"swordfish,\" you need to call the `decrypt()` method on the object and      provide the password as an argument before you can obtain `Page` objects from it. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   pdf_reader.decrypt('swordfish')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To rotate a page in `PyPDF2`, you can use the `rotateClockwise()` or `rotateCounterClockwise()` methods on a `Page` object. These methods    accept an angle (in degrees) as an argument. Positive values rotate the page clockwise, while negative values rotate it counterclockwise.    Here are examples of both methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   page.rotateClockwise(90)  # Rotate page 90 degrees clockwise\n",
    "   page.rotateCounterClockwise(180)  # Rotate page 180 degrees counterclockwise\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In `python-docx`, a `Run` object represents a contiguous run of text within a paragraph. It can have different formatting applied to it, such as font styles and sizes. On the other hand, a `Paragraph` object represents a single paragraph of text in a Word document. It consists of one or more `Run` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. To obtain a list of `Paragraph` objects for a `Document` object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can use the `paragraphs` property. Accessing `doc.paragraphs` will give you a list of `Paragraph` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `Run` object in `python-docx` has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables. These variables represent the formatting attributes applied to the text run.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In `python-docx`, for the `bold` variable:\n",
    "   - `False` indicates that the text is not bold.\n",
    "   - `True` indicates that the text is bold.\n",
    "   - `None` indicates that the text's boldness is determined by the parent style or is unspecified.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. To create a `Document` object for a new Word document, you can use the `Document()` constructor without any arguments. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    doc = Document()  # Creates a new Document object\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. To add a paragraph with the text \"Hello, there!\" to a `Document` object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can use the `add_paragraph()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    doc.add_paragraph(\"Hello, there!\")  # Adds a paragraph with the specified text to the document\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In Word documents, the levels of headings are represented by integers from 1 to 9. The higher the integer value, the lower the level of the heading. For example, a level 1 heading is the highest level, while a level 9 heading is the lowest level."
